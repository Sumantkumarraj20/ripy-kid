Step 1: Create Supabase Project

Log into Supabase â†’ Create new project (Free tier).

Note your SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY.

Enable Auth with email/password.

Create your database tables (via SQL editor) with the schema above.

Step 2: Set Up Next.js App

In terminal:

npx create-next-app kid-track-web --typescript
cd kid-track-web
npm install @supabase/supabase-js tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p


In .env.local, add:

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>


In lib/supabaseClient.ts:

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl  = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!;
const supabaseKey  = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!;
export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);


Setup Tailwind config (as usual).

Step 3: Authentication + Role Logic

On signup, insert a record into users table with role 'parent' (or caretakers/teachers).

Use Supabase Auth session to get user.id.

Fetch users row to check role and children_ids.

In UI, show different dashboards/forms depending on role.

Step 4: Data Entry UIs

Child profile page: Create/Edit children (parents/teachers).

Daily Routine Form: For each child, allow logging of major activities (hygiene, eating, screen time) and submit as a summary. In UI you can still capture detailed events but optionally store only aggregated summary.

Learning & Feedback Form: Teachers/caretakers fill task descriptions, scores, comments.

Growth & Milestone Entry: For parents/caregivers to fill once per week/month.

Use custom hooks like useDailySummary(childId, date) to fetch and cache.

Step 5: Dashboard + Analytics

Use charting library (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts) to plot:

Height/weight vs time

ActivityScore trend

LearningScore by subject

Milestone completions

Use aggregated data from daily_summaries table â€” this keeps queries small and efficient.

Step 6: Optimize for Free Tier & Scalability

Avoid heavy reads: Query only daily_summaries for recent days rather than full event logs.

Archive/Prune events table: After e.g., 6 months move detailed events to archive or delete to keep DB size small.

Batch writes: If capturing many events, you could buffer in frontend and write once per day.

Use efficient indexes in Postgres (e.g., on child_id, date) so queries stay fast/coast-low.

Monitor usage: Supabase dashboard shows DB size, query cost. Stay under 500MB and free plan limits.

Step 7: Deployment

Deploy frontend: e.g., using Vercel or Netlify (free tier).

Connect environment variables securely.

Use Supabase as backend (no server-cost).

Set up production database and enable backups (Supabase free plan has auto-backups but monitor).

ðŸ§  Research/Data-Generation Specifics

Ensure you capture timestamps & metadata (who logged, when, any context).

Use anonymized child IDs for research export (strip PII).

Create exports route: allow admin to download CSV of aggregated data (daily_summaries) for analysis.

Add versioning: When you tweak questionnaire (activity types, learning subjects) log schema_version in summaries so you know which version the data used.

Build optional flag: needs_intervention boolean on daily_summaries (computed by simple heuristic) to alert educator/parent.

ðŸ§° Tech Stack Summary

Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Charting Library

Backend/BaaS: Supabase (Auth + Postgres + Storage)

Hosting: Vercel/Netlify (free plans)

Database: Postgres schema as above, RLS policies for security

Analytics: Client-side charts + export CSV for deeper research

Cost-optimization: Daily summaries, pruning old data, efficient queries
